# Why software development isn’t a linear process

Embarking on a custom software development project is essentially crossing into uncharted territory.
Although we most likely won’t face dragons, there are risks. But, it’s by taking risks that you reap
rewards. The creation of new software with custom functionality gives you a powerful tool that’s
unique to your business. Building that tool requires trusting in a non-linear process.

**Software development is called an empirical process because the requirements are expected to
evolve;** the process can’t be defined from the start with a set series of steps. To people outside
the software development world, this flexible process is often a surprise. Within the industry,
Agile software development and the Agile manifesto are well known. I like this quote from
[Estimation is Evil](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-02/estimation-is-evil) by Ron Jeffries,
Signatory of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development:

> Most of us were taught to write down all our requirements at the very beginning of the project.
> There are only three things wrong with this: “requirements,” “the very beginning,” and “all.” At
> the very beginning, we know less about our project than we’ll ever know again. This is the worst
> possible moment to be making firm decisions about what we “require.”

Of course, we start with discovery and a plan, but it’s more useful to think of the plan as the
definition of the project’s value rather than a destination. For deliverables, we use the adaptive
approach favoured by Agile methodology. What that means is we develop and deliver features
incrementally. Regular delivery of working software gives our clients the opportunity to see value
early. Incremental delivery also builds confidence in the team and our process, and gives clients
the opportunity to provide feedback right away.

## Collaboration and communication are essential for product success

As we embark on the process of creating something unique, issues, questions, and problems will
arise. These challenges are an expected part of the process, and they serve as opportunities to
recalibrate the project’s value. Throughout the project, our team collaborates with the client team
to find the simplest, best solutions to every problem. In some cases, a problem may be a rare
occurrence that’s best solved by allowing manual intervention rather than increasing the scope of
the project and expending more resources.

## Project value must take priority

To minimize problems, it’s essential to keep functionality and value as priorities. Two factors can
threaten functionality and value are feature requests with low return on investment, and schedule
constraints. It’s normal for some additional feature requests to arise after the project is
underway, but to maintain project integrity, those new features must be evaluated against the
overall goals for the project. New features may be great ideas, but can also cause endless rework
and compromise the forward momentum of the project.

Meeting scheduled milestones is important to keep the project moving in the right direction.
However, there can be instances where sticking to the immediate schedule could have a high cost in
the long term. If implementing the best solution to an issue requires some schedule flexibility,
then a difficult decision must be made. Sticking to the schedule purely on principle doesn’t support
the objective of creating a unique product with high value.

While in a sense a product is the result of software development, the process is closer to research
than manufacturing. New information will be revealed as the process moves along. Each new piece of
information must be evaluated and incorporated to best serve the overall project. If the schedule
takes priority over project value, essential information may be discarded to the detriment of the
project’s overall value.

The reason for examining these misunderstandings isn’t to cause hesitation in starting a project. My
intention is to offer some insight about why the process isn’t straightforward and why we want to
keep it that way. Ongoing discovery throughout the process allows the end results to be innovative
and transformative.
