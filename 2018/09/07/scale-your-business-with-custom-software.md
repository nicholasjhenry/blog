# Scale your business with custom software

When demand increases and is about to cross a significant threshold, it’s an opportunity to show what a company is made of and how solid its foundation is. Will existing internal processes be able to handle the increased pressure and volume? A tailored software solution can help ease the transition when scaling rapidly by offering many advantages.

## Automating manual processes

The easy win for a custom software solution is replacing manual processes. Anything that can be automated will save time incrementally as more people use the system. Triggering notifications is one common process that can save the time that would otherwise be required to send individual messages. Showing time saved for existing processes can provide bottom-line, easy-to understand numbers that get projects approved from finance and accounting, but the bigger wins for businesses often exist beyond basic automation.

## Streamlining procedures

An extremely valuable benefit of developing custom software happens before even one line of code is written. In the discovery phase, the essential processes used by the business must be defined and deemed necessary to support the company’s objectives. This step can be revelatory as the need for custom software often occurs at a pivotal point in a company’s growth. By clearly defining objectives and priorities before a rapid growth phase, everyone who interacts with the company as it grows will have a clear understanding of what the company does.

Each person using the custom software can do exactly what’s needed without workarounds. People interacting with the company will also have a cohesive experience of not waiting for information to be retrieved slowly from an outdated legacy system.

## Improving quality

An important side benefit of streamlined procedures is improving data quality. Having reliable, high quality data in your system can prevent costly errors. A well-designed system can easily handle increasing volume and produce results that don’t require manual intervention or double-checking.

## Allowing flexibility

Since you own your custom software, if you need something changed you can have it done. This isn’t possible with an off-the shelf solution. You can ask, but your innovative idea may not align with what the majority of users are doing, and your essential new feature won’t be implemented. Or maybe you don’t want to give your great idea away to someone else to sell it with their product, you want to keep it for your use only. Your custom software evolves as your company grows and includes the new features you prioritize as your capabilities expand.

## Broadening reach

Custom software solutions in 2018 have little to no resemblance to pre-cloud proprietary systems developed in-house. The software development tools and cloud storage solutions available now make online, collaborative systems a smart choice for many businesses.

Online accessibility allows remote access for people travelling and can often accommodate different devices. If salespeople need access using smartphones and tablets, it can be done. Top talent often expects to have remote access and to be able to bring their own devices. A constrained, local-access only system can be a hindrance to growth.

A well-designed custom software solution that supports key business functions allows each user to work at high levels of efficiency. Having a reliable, efficient system in place is an excellent strategy to prepare for rapid growth.
