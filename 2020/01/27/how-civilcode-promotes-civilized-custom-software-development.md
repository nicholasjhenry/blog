# How CivilCode promotes civilized custom software development

The origins of the disciplined methodology used by CivilCode can be traced to the early careers of
the company’s two co-founders: [Nicholas Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasjhenry/) and
[Hugo Frappier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugofrappier/). Both were independent contractors whose
paths crossed on projects and at industry conferences, notably the annual [Ruby on Rails
Conference](https://railsconf.com/).

In addition to sharing the same opinion of how to use a disciplined approach to develop software,
Nicholas and Hugo also discovered that they were both interested in increasing the complexity of the
type of projects that they were working on independently.

## When technology met opportunity

The future co-founders of CivilCode also agreed that they wanted to use Elixir as one of the key
components in their technology stack. When [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) became available,
Nicholas and Hugo started to seriously investigate working together in a structured company to move
beyond collaborating independently.

Another contributing factor to the creation of CivilCode was a market need to fill a gap that wasn’t
being well served. Small and medium-sized businesses that outgrew their off-the-shelf software
required more than an individual developer could provide but weren’t the right fit for a large
software consultancy.

Through multiple discussions and their own discovery process, Nicholas and Hugo ironed out their
niche: developing custom software to automate business workflows and solve clients’ process
problems.

## Where the name CivilCode came from

A major component of the work environment and company values that Nicholas and Hugo wanted to create
is centred around using a disciplined or “civilized” approach to software development. From the
start, CivilCode has implemented its methodology on all projects.

This methodology includes:

* an in-depth discovery phase that uses story mapping and
  [event storming](../../../2018/08/31/why-software-development-starts-with-sticky-notes.md) to clarify
  user tasks and goals, and reveal the required business processes
* iterative development for continuous delivery of incremental releases
* [pair programming](../../../2019/02/15/how-we-use-pair-programming-to-develop-high-quality-software.md)
  for high-quality software
* [billing blocks](../../../2019/10/18/minimizing-the-cost-of-context-switching.md) of developer
  time instead of fixed-price project fees devoting one day per week to professional development,
  research, and contributions to open-source software development projects

## How CivilCode is different from a digital design agency

By focusing on building the applications that run a business, CivilCode sets itself apart from
digital design agencies that specialize in developing mobile apps and Software as a Service for
startups.

When a small or medium-sized business is growing and struggling with off-the-shelf solutions, they
require developers that have extensive business workflow expertise. With experience developing
software for industries ranging from heavily regulated healthcare to creative digital music
creation, the developers at CivilCode are uniquely positioned to solve business-specific workflow
problems.

## Who benefits most from working with CivilCode

Outgrowing an off-the-shelf software solution is a good problem to have. Established small and
medium-size businesses that need custom software to streamline their internal processes are an ideal
fit for CivilCode.

When manual processes, wrong tools, and inefficient procedures prevent a company from scaling as it
should, custom software applications can open up growth opportunities without increasing
administrative headcount. Having control over custom software development is also of great value to
CivilCode clients.
